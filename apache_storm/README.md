## Apache Storm

This directory contains a Kotlin project with a few topologies I'm writing as I learn the basics of Storm. They are all running on LocalMode, so there is no need
to spin up a cluster yet.

Check out the docs:
- [Apache Storm core concepts](https://storm.apache.org/releases/2.2.0/Concepts.html)
- [Apache Storm tutorial](https://storm.apache.org/releases/2.2.0/Tutorial.html)
- [Apache Storm local mode](http://storm.apache.org/releases/current/Local-mode.html)
